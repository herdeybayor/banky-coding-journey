### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How the Web Works (30 minutes)

#### The Pizza Delivery Story üçï

```mermaid

    participant Kid as You/Browser
    participant Phone as Internet
    participant Pizza as Web Server
    participant Driver as Data Transfer
    
    Note over Kid,Driver: Ordering a Pizza = Requesting a Website
    
    Kid->>Phone: "I want a pizza!"<br/>(Type URL)
    Phone->>Pizza: Send order<br/>(HTTP Request)
    Note over Pizza: Make pizza<br/>(Process request)
    Pizza->>Driver: Pizza ready<br/>(Server response)
    Driver->>Kid: Deliver pizza<br/>(Webpage data)
    
    Note over Kid: Enjoy!<br/>(View webpage)
```

#### Real-world Comparison:
- Browser = You (hungry for a website)
- Web Address = Pizza place phone number
- Server = Pizza kitchen
- Internet = Delivery driver
- Webpage = Your delivered pizza

#### Common Issues:
- Wrong address = Typo in URL
- Pizza place closed = Server down
- Slow delivery = Slow internet
- Wrong order = Error in webpage
